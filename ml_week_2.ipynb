        "1. Создается генератор разбиений sklearn.model_selection.KFold, который задает набор разбиений на обучение и валидацию. Число блоков в кросс-валидации определяется параметром n_splits. Обратите внимание, что порядок следования объектов в выборке может быть неслучайным, это может привести к смещенности кросс-валидационной оценки. Чтобы устранить такой эффект, объекты выборки случайно перемешивают перед разбиением на блоки. Для перемешивания достаточно передать генератору KFold параметр shuffle=True.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Вычислить качество на всех разбиениях можно при помощи функции sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score. В качестве параметра estimator передается классификатор, в качестве параметра cv — генератор разбиений с предыдущего шага. С помощью параметра scoring можно задавать меру качества, по умолчанию в задачах классификации используется доля верных ответов (accuracy). Результатом является массив, значения которого нужно усреднить."
